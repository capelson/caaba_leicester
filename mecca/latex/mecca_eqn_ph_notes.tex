\note{PH2100_a01}{2.33 times the gas-phase value}

\note{PH3200_a01}{Scaled to J(\kpp{NO2}) so that its lifetime is about 10.5 days, as suggested by \citet{949}.}

\note{PH4200_a01}{CH3CHOHO2 is assumed to directly decompose into CH3CHO + HO2}

\note{PH4201_a01}{COOHOO is not formed but directly dissociates into CO2 + HO2}

\note{PH4202_a01}{assumed to be the same as C2H5OOH + hv}

\note{PH4207a_a01}{Quantum yields from \citet{3245}.}

\note{PH4207b_a01}{Quantum yields from \citet{3245}. HCOCH2O2 decomposes directly to .6 HCHO + .6 CO + .6 HO2 + .2 GLYOX + .2 HOCH2CHO}

\note{PH4211_a01}{Assumed in analogy to the main channel for $j$(\chem{HOCH2CHO}).}

\note{PH4300_a01}{2.33* $k$ from the gas-phase reaction, CH3CO directly reacts with O2 to form CH3CO3}

\note{PH4301_a01}{2.33 * $k$ from the gas-phase reaction,}

\note{PH4302_a01}{Following \citet{1584}, we use j(\kpp{ACETOL}) = \code{0.11*jx(ip_CHOH)}. As an additional factor, the quantum yield of 0.65 is taken from \citet{2510}. CH3CO reacts with O2 to form OH + HCHO + CO. HOCH2CO reacts with O2 to form HOCH2CO3}
